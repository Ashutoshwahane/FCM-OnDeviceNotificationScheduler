## Introduction
- We can use [***Cloud Pub/Sub***](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/schedule-functions) with [***Firebase Cloud Functions***](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to send FCM Push Notifications. But this solution is costly to implement.
- Here, We are using regular FCM Push Notifications and scheduling it *on device*.

In this demo app, We are subscribing to a FCM Channel *`discount-offers`*. We'll receive **Data** payload from FCM to this subscribed channel and we will process and schedule it.

## Dependencies
- [**`Firebase Messaging`**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client) - Firebase Cloud Messaging Library.
- **`Firebase IID`** - Firebase Instance ID Library.
- [**`WorkManager`**](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - Used for Background Work Processing.

## Setup
- Setup project in Firebase Console.
- Download and paste `google-services.json`  configuration file in `/app` directory.
- Keep legacy API key for FCM Push Notification REST.

## Implementation Structure

```

- ***`MyFirebaseMessagingService`***: FCM Receiver Service Implementation. Process of Notification Scheduling using `AlarmManager` is implemented here.
- ***`NotificationBroadcastReceiver`***: `BroadcastReceiver` Implementation. Executed when AlarmManager is triggered. WorkManager is initiated and executed for background processing.
- ***`ScheduledWorker`***: `WorkManager` Implementation. Notification is displayed in the system tray and other background processed are executed.

- ***`NotificationUtil`***: Implementation to display Notification on the system tray.
- ***`SettingUtil`***: Function implementation to check whether *Automatic Date & Time* setting is ON/OFF.

- ***`MainActivity`***: UI Implementation to subscribe to FCM Channel.

## What's Happening? ü§î
- Subscribe to *`discount-offers`* FCM Channel from Android Device.
- **Data Payload** will be as follows
```json
 { 
    "to": "/topics/discount-offers", 
    "priority": "high",
    "data" : {
      "title" : "TITLE_HERE",
      "message" : "MESSAGE_HERE",
      "isScheduled" : "true",
      "scheduledTime" : "2019-12-13 09:41:00"
    }
}
```
  *Format of `scheduledTime`: **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS***
- Receive FCM on device and `onMessageReceived()` in [`MyFirebaseMessagingService`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/FCM-OnDeviceNotificationScheduler/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/spdroid/schedulefcm/example/fcm/MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt) will be invoked. In this, following operations will be done-
  - If `isScheduled` parameter received is `false` then notifications is displayed in system tray **instantly**.
  - If `isScheduled` is `true` then `scheduledTime` is parsed from payload and `AlarmManager` is used to set *one-time* alarm at that time and [`NotificationBroadcastReceiver`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/FCM-OnDeviceNotificationScheduler/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/spdroid/schedulefcm/example/fcm/NotificationBroadcastReceiver.kt) implementation will be executed on that time.
  - In `onReceive()`, we have scheduled a *WorkManager* [`ScheduledWorker`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/FCM-OnDeviceNotificationScheduler/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/spdroid/schedulefcm/example/fcm/ScheduledWorker.kt) for background work processing. There in `doWork()`, we're finally we're displaying Notification on system tray. Do any background proessing and return status from *WorkManager*.
  
Hurrah!üòç we have successfully implemented On-Device Scheduling of FCM Push Notificationüëç.

## Let's Test It
I have sent below payload with to the FCM Channel (*`discount-offers`*).

```json
{ 
 "to": "/topics/discount-offers", 
 "priority": "high",
 "data" : {
  "title" : "üéÖ Christmas Offer üéÑ",
  "message" : "Grab 90% Discount üòç on Mobile Phones",
  "isScheduled" : "true",
  "scheduledTime" : "2019-12-13 14:12:00"
 }
}
```

üöÄSee output below and notice that **Internet/Wi-Fi** is ***OFF*** still at exactly 02:12 pm I'm getting a notification on the system tray üòÉ.

Yippie üòç! It's working as expected. Hope you liked that. If you find it helpful please share this. Maybe it'll help someone needy!
